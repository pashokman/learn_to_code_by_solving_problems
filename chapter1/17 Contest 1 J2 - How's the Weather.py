Woburn Challenge 2017-18 Round 1 - Junior Division

"Ugh, It's been so hot out lately, why does it have to be 32 degreesâ€¦"
"32 degrees? That's freezing!"

You've had quite enough of confusing conversations with Americans who assume you're using Fahrenheit when Celsius 
is clearly the way to go. Rather than argue with them, you've settled for writing a program to conveniently 
convert temperatures measured in degrees Celsius to Fahrenheit instead.

You came across the following formula, which holds true given that F is a temperature in degrees Fahrenheit while C
is that same temperature in degrees Celsius:

C = 5 / 9 * (F - 32)

Given a value of C, which is an integer between -40 and 40 (inclusive), determine the corresponding value of F, 
so that you can express the equivalent temperature in degrees Fahrenheit for the Americans' benefit.

It's guaranteed that C will be chosen such that F will come out to exactly an integer, but you may output it with 0 
or more digits after the decimal point.

Input Specification
The first and only line of input consists of a single integer, C.

Output Specification
Output a single integer, the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit which is equivalent to C degrees Celsius.

F = C / (5/9) + 32

Sample Input
20
Sample Output
68
